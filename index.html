      <p><li><b>Speaker and Interviews:</b> In this podcast, the main speaker is the journalist, who is supported by multiple interviews and evidence, ultimately forming a cohesive narrative through her lens. Thus, the majority of the podcast's communication through the interviews with people who had first hand accounts of the murder, including all major witnesses. These interviews also take many forms, such as audio from police investigations, phone, and one-on-one interviews.</li>
      <li><b>Structure and Script:</b> This is set up much like the previous podcast, investigative journalism. It has a tone similar to S-town, but it differs in structure. The bulk of the episode is interviews with different people rather than just one person, but both podcasts show insight into the interviewers opinions. Again, the script is half and half; interviews and phone calls are not scripted, but the interviewer interjections of her opinions are scripted somewhat. This podcast still has a looser feel than S-town, but it's just as cohesive as they lay out her argument and the facts concisely.</li>
      <li><b>Music and Sounds:</b> The music and sounds are even less in this podcast, with only a little music throughout the narrative. No other audio bites were used besides the interviews.</li>

      <h3><b><i>S-town</i> Podcast</b></h3>
       <div class="w3-container">
      <p><li><b>Speakers and Interviews:</b> The two main speakers in the narrative are the investigator and John, the informant of the reporter. They share an equal amount of time carrying the story throughout, with John a more active speaker in the interrogation, and the investigator when either reflecting on is doubts about the case or summarizing the information given by John. And while the narrative does follow an interview style, there are no interviews of note that aren't fictitious.</li>
      <li><b>Structure and Script:</b> This podcast is structured much like a mystery television show. However, as solely an audio medium, the creators must capture the style of a murder mystery through it's script and pacing, what with the lack of visual aids. Meanwhile, the script itself is half and half; scripted parts are when the reporter is discussing John with his listeners, giving the murder mystery feel that the podcast needs to be close to a television show. However, the parts where John and the other towns folk give their accounts of the story are unscripted, allowing the listener to achieve and realistic and organic tone that is unique to podcasts.</li>
      <li><b>Music and Sounds:</b> The music and sounds added  ultimately enrich the narrative when they do appear. The sound choice throughout is subtle, like background noise, and very realistic, making it easier for the listener to visualize the scene. </li>

      <h4><b><i>Serial</i> Content</b></h4>
      <p>This podcast follows a journalist as she interviews every major eye witness and all first hand accounts she can get her hands on for an open-ended murder case. Just like S-town, the genre of the podcast is murder mystery, but is not so much a faux-television program and more like a window into investigative journalism.</p>
