      <p><li><b>Speaker and Interviews:</b> There are multiple speakers in the Radiolab podcast, operating more as a conversation while they tell the story. And while they often talk over each other and stuttered a bit more, it gave the podcast an organic and improvisational style. The podcast itself is based on many interviews conducted throughout the recording, but still manages to make the narrative conversational.</li>
      <li><b>Structure and Script:</b> Just as how the speakers acted in an informal yet genuine manner, the structure follows suit by acting as more of a conversation than a lecture. But that isn't to say it isn't cohesive; the speakers do a very good job emphasizing key points and keeping a general flow to the podcast, with no lulls or excessive repetition. They would occasionally get off-topic, but it was typically funny and always maintained a quick and lively feel.</li>
      <li><b>Music and Sounds:</b> This podcast really maximized it's audio medium, as they used a wide variety of sounds, ranging from choir music to sound bites of real people. Either for comedic purposes or for added explanation, they always enriched the podcast.</li>

      <h3><b><i>S-town</i> Podcast</b></h3>
       <div class="w3-container">
      <p><li><b>Speakers and Interviews:</b> There is primarily one speaker, who plays the main character of the story, Heidi. There are other characters that she interacts with, though, since this follows a more structured story.</li>
      <li><b>Structure and Script:</b> Unlike Radiolab, Homecoming is much more structured and scripted, rather than ad-libbed. This is because the podcast follows more of a narrative and not a conversation. Plus, there is a defined script, which is comprised mainly of Heidi's thoughts and her interactions with others. With this in mind, there aren't really any interviews to speak.</li>
      <li><b>Music and Sounds:</b> The music and sounds added are less flambouyant than the Radiolab ones, as well as less frequent, but these additions still enrich the narrative when they appear. The sound choice throughout is subtle, like background noise, making it easier for the listener to visualize the scene. And then there is the eerie piano music at the beginning and end, establishing the tone of the story perfectly.</li>

      <h4><b><i>Serial</i> Content</b></h4>
      <p>This podcast discusses the topic of colors, with the conversation of the podcast jumping from Sir Isaac Newton and his prisms, to how there are shrimps that have sixteen different cones in their eyes, to Tetrachromatic women, and on and on. The hosts, Jad and Robert, often side-track from their narrative in a comical way, but always pull back to focus.</p>

      <h4><b><i>S-town</i> Content</b></h4>
      <p>Homecoming is structure almost cinematically, jumping back and forth between the present and five years in the past. The main character, Heidi, is working at Homecoming in the past, and is working as a server being questioned by the DOD in the present.</p>
